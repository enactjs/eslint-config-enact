# eslint-config-enact

> A set of linting rules designed by the Enact team.

This module includes both a standard set of rules and a set of stricter rules that represent the Enact team style.

## Usage

Reference this set of rules from your `.eslintrc` or `package.json` file and then use `eslint`.  If you are using the `cli` tools, simply use `npm run lint` from your project directory.

For more information (including editor/IDE setup), please see the [docs](docs/index.md).

## Installation

`eslint-config-enact` can be installed locally or globally.  The following command will install the config and all its dependencies globally:

```bash
npm install -g eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-babel babel-eslint eslint-plugin-enact eslint-config-enact
```

>**NOTE**: Using the [`cli` tools](https://github.com/enactjs/cli/) to create your projects eliminates the need to globally install these dependencies unless you wish editor integration.
